## The ADFA Linux Dataset (ADFA-LD)

[ADFA-LD dataset](<https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-IDS-Datasets/>) provides a contemporary Linux dataset for evaluation by traditional HIDS. Details of the dataset are contained in the following papers and thesis, which should be cited by academics using this dataset:

Someone kindly reminds me that `ADFA-LD+Syscall+List.txt`  doesn't exist in the official downloadlink. Actually, it is from  [this post](<https://www.researchgate.net/post/Were_can_I_get_a_labelled_version_of_the_ADFA-LD_dataset_for_HIDS_evaluation>) . I download it and packaged them together in this repository.

Hoping this repository can be helpful for you and your research. :D
